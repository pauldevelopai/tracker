# Run after pushing changes. Handles the things that are easy to forget:
#   - the CLIENT must be rebuilt (npm run build) for any front-end change to go
#     live — editing source alone does nothing until the bundle is rebuilt;
#   - DB migrations run;
#   - the SERVER is restarted under pm2 to load route changes.
#
# Caddy is NOT touched here (it rarely changes). If you changed the Caddy config,
# remember: `sudo systemctl restart caddy` (it has `admin off`, so `reload` fails).
